# API Refactoring Summary

## Removed Redundant Endpoints

1. **`/api/locker`** - Removed this endpoint as it was redundant with `/api/lockers`
2. **`/api/register`** - Removed this empty/unused endpoint

## Standardized API Responses

1. **Consistent format** - Updated the `/api/subscription-types` endpoint to return a standardized response format:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "subscriptionTypes": [...],
     ...
   }
   ```

## Renamed and Clarified Access Endpoints

1. **Created `/api/access/direct`** - A clearer name for hardware device access (previously `/api/access/external`)
2. **Created `/api/access/authenticated`** - A clearer name for authenticated user access (previously `/api/lockers/external`)
3. **Added proper documentation** - Added detailed inline documentation for each endpoint explaining its purpose and usage

## Maintained Backward Compatibility

1. **Added redirects** - Added 308 redirects from old endpoints to new ones to maintain compatibility
   - `/api/access/external` → `/api/access/direct`
   - `/api/lockers/external` → `/api/access/authenticated`
2. **Updated hooks** - Modified hooks.server.ts to handle both old and new endpoint paths for CORS

## Updated Documentation

1. **Created updated API documentation** - Added `API-updated.md` with comprehensive documentation of all endpoints
2. **Added deprecation notices** - Added clear deprecation notices for old endpoints

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Better error handling** - Added standardized error handling that provides consistent responses
2. **Improved logging** - Added more descriptive logs to help with debugging
3. **Eliminated any types** - Fixed non-specific 'any' types with proper type definitions

## Next Steps for Further Refactoring

1. **Update clients** - Update all client code to use the new endpoints
2. **Add response type definitions** - Create comprehensive response type definitions
3. **Create service abstraction layer** - Move business logic to service files
4. **Remove deprecated endpoints** - After a transition period, remove the old redirecting endpoints
