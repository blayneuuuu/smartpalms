## Cron Jobs

SmartPalms uses Vercel Cron Jobs to perform scheduled tasks:

### Subscription Expiration Notifications

SmartPalms runs two daily cron jobs to check for subscriptions that expire on the current day and send email notifications to affected users:

1. **Primary check**: Runs at midnight (00:00)
2. **Secondary check**: Runs at noon (12:00) as backup

This dual-check system ensures users receive notifications even if one of the jobs fails to execute properly.

Configuration:

- Both jobs are defined in `vercel.json` with schedules of `0 0 * * *` and `0 12 * * *`
- The jobs call the `/api/cron/check-expiring-subscriptions` endpoint
- Authentication is handled automatically by Vercel's cron job system

To test this functionality locally:

1. Visit `/api/test/check-expiring-subscriptions` to see subscriptions expiring today (no emails are sent)
2. Check your email configuration with `/test-email`

For more information on Vercel Cron Jobs, see the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs).
